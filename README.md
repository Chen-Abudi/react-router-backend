## 🧰 Tech Stack:

- React + React Router

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS

## 🛠️ Techniques:

- **`React Router Dom Hooks`**:

  - **useLoaderData**: Is a hook that helps to fetch the data for the component before it renders. It improves performance and prevents empty states.

    **`Note`**: This hook can be used only in the element that's assigned to a route **AND** in all components that might be used inside that element but not on a higher level route.

  - **useRouteLoaderData**: Is a hook that efficiently manages loading states and data for specific routes. It optimizes rendering by fetching data only when needed, enhancing user experience.

- Relative Paths
- **`React Hooks`**:
  - **useParams**: This hook gives an access to multiple contents in the same URL path, then it enables each parameter to have a unique identification.
- **`React Router Components`**:
  - **NavLink**: Is used for navigation between pages.
  - **Outlet**: Is a component provided by React Router that serves as a placeholder for child routes within a parent route.
- **Nested Routes, Indexed Routes, and Dynamic Routes**.
- **Handling Errors, and use Custom Error Handler**.
